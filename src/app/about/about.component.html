                    Do you live in a rural or suburban area? Have you ever been stuck without a car? If so,
                    you may have found it difficult to get to work or school. Public transit mostly only
                    exists in urban areas, which is unfortunate for those who do not live in such places.
                    FarPool is here to help! With FarPool, you can create and join carpools to wherever
                    you need to go.

                    FarPool was created out of a desire to create better public transit in America. 
                    The United States has fallen behind other countries when it comes to public 
                    transportation. While many countries, especially those in Europe, have reliable 
                    bus and train systems, the United States is dependent on the private car. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This is especially true for those living in rural or suburban areas. 
                    Very few of these areas have any public transit. Thus, those who cannot afford 
                    a car may be very limited in terms of job opportunity. Even in urban areas, 
                    U.S. public transit can be slow and unreliable.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The benefits of public transit are hard to ignore. It creates jobs, 
                    reduces carbon emissions, and lowers gasoline use. It can even help people 
                    escape poverty. These are reasons why public transportation in the U.S. 
                    should be improved. FarPool aims to make life in the US better through 
                    reliable public transit.

                    Software Design & Development. This website is a project for their 
                    Client-Side Programming class. Liam was inspired to make FarPool after seeing 
                    firsthand how difficult it can be to get a job when a person lives in a 
                    rural area without a car.
