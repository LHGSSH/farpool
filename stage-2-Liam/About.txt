FarPool was created out of a desire to create better public transit in America. The United States has fallen behind other countries when it comes to public transportation. While many countries, especially those in Europe, have reliable bus and train systems, the United States is dependent on the private car. This is especially true for those living in rural or suburban areas. Very few of these areas have any public transit. Thus, those who cannot afford a car may be very limited in terms of job opportunity. Even in urban areas, U.S. public transit can be slow and unreliable.

The benefits of public transit are hard to ignore. It creates jobs, reduces carbon emissions, and lowers gasoline use. It can even help people escape poverty. These are reasons why public transportation in the U.S. should be improved. FarPool aims to make life in the US better through reliable public transit.

ABOUT THE CREATOR
Liam Hilton-Green is a junior at the University of West Florida studying Software Design & Development. This website is a project for his Client-Side Programming class. He was inspired to make FarPool after seeing firsthand how difficult it can be to get a job when a person lives in a rural area without a car.
