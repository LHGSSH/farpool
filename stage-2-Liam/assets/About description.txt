The United States has fallen behind other countries when it comes to public transportation.
                While many countries, especially those in Europe, have reliable bus and train systems,
                the United States is dependent on the private car. This is especially true for those living
                in rural or suburban areas. Very few of these areas have any public transit. Thus, those
                who cannot afford a car may be very limited in terms of job opportunity. Even in urban areas,
                U.S. public transit can be slow and unreliable.

                The benefits of public transit are hard to ignore. <a href="https://www.apta.com/news-publications/public-transportation-benefits/">It creates jobs, reduces carbon emissions, 
                    and lowers gasoline use.</a> It can even <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/07/upshot/transportation-emerges-as-crucial-to-escaping-poverty.html">help people escape poverty.</a>
                    These are reasons why public transportation in the U.S. should be improved. We may be able to help do this
                    by creating some apps.
