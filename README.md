# Farpool

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.0.6.

Before beginning our collaboration, Nick's project was a carpool app for UWF that would reward students for driving each other around by handing out free parking passes. My project was a nationwide carpool app, one aimed specifically at people in rural areas. When combining our projects, we considered "meeting in the middle" and making a carpool app for the Pensacola area. However, we decided against doing so because it would be too similar to Uber. We agreed to move in my direction with the project and keep making a nationwide carpool app.
