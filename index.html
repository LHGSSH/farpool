            <h2>Topic Overview</h2>
            <p>The United States has fallen behind other countries when it comes to public transportation.
                While many countries, especially those in Europe, have reliable bus and train systems,
                the United States is dependent on the private car. This is especially true for those living
                in rural or suburban areas. Very few of these areas have any public transit. Thus, those
                who cannot afford a car may be very limited in terms of job opportunity. Even in urban areas,
                U.S. public transit can be slow and unreliable.
            </p>
            <p>
                The benefits of public transit are hard to ignore. <a href="https://www.apta.com/news-publications/public-transportation-benefits/">It creates jobs, reduces carbon emissions, 
                and lowers gasoline use.</a> It can even <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/07/upshot/transportation-emerges-as-crucial-to-escaping-poverty.html">help people escape poverty.</a>
                These are reasons why public transportation in the U.S. should be improved. We may be able to help do this
                by creating some apps.

            <h2>Potential Applications</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>A carpooling site aimed at rural/suburban communities. This site would allow users to
                    start a carpool and define when it will be active and where it will be going. It would also
                    allow users to search for locations, see what carpools are going to them, and sign up for one.
                </li>
                <li>A bike sharing site aimed at urban areas. Would allow people to find nearby bikes available
                    for use, borrow them, and then return them when they're done. The site could have "hotspot" areas
                    where people can drop off and pick up bikes.
